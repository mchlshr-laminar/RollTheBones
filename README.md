# Roll The Bones
An Android application for rolling dice.

## Roll Screen
From the main screen you can roll or reroll a pool of dice. The total of the last roll is displayed at the top of the screen.

## Configuration Screen
Dice pools can be edited here. Different types of dice can be added to the pool, as well as fixed value modifiers. The roll button will transition to the roll screen and roll the pool.

## Menu Screen
The menu has two tabs. Items in the tabs can be long-clicked to select them in order to delete them.
### Saved Pools tab
This tab shows any dice pool setups that have been saved, from the roll screen or the configuration screen.
### Custom Dice tab
This tab shows any custom dice that the user has built, using the custom die type activity.

## Custom Die Type Screen
From this screen the user can build and save new types of dice. These dice will have a contiguous range of integers for the numeric result they produce, and may have images assigned for the different faces of the die. For instance, a user could build a three-sided die (result range 1-3), or a die where the minimum result is greater than 1. They could also import images of the faces of non-numeric dice that come with a variety of board games.
